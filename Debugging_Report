Debugging Report for sort_words_Selection() Function

[1 mark] Setting up effective breakpoints in VSCode:
1. Opened VSCode Debug view (Ctrl+Shift+D)
2. Set breakpoints by clicking in the left margin:
   - Line 142: Start of sort_words_Selection function
   - Line 158: First comparison where Bug 1 occurs
   - Line 166: Swap condition where Bug 2 occurs
3. Verified breakpoints are active (red dots appear)

[1 mark] Setting up effective variable watches:
1. In Debug view's WATCH section, added:
   - words (to monitor array contents)
   - i (outer loop position)
   - j (inner loop position)
   - minIndex (current minimum element index)
2. Added expression 'words[i]' and 'words[minIndex]' to compare values
3. Arranged watch window to clearly show all variables

[1 mark] Evidence of Buggy Behavior:

Bug 1 - Incorrect Comparison:
- Debugger paused at line 158 shows:
  * VARIABLES window:
    - i = 0 (points to "programming")
    - j = 1 (points to "milan")
    - minIndex = 0
  * WATCH window shows:
    - words[i] = "programming" (incorrectly used for comparison)
    - Should be using words[minIndex] instead
  * Step-by-step execution shows comparison always using first element

Bug 2 - Incorrect Swap Condition:
- At line 166 breakpoint:
  * VARIABLES window shows:
    - minIndex = 4 (points to "banana")
    - j = 5 (last element)
    - i = 0 (current position)
  * Condition 'minIndex != j' fails to swap when needed
  * Debug console shows swaps being skipped

[1 mark] Evidence of Fixed Behavior:

1. After fixing Bug 1 (using words[minIndex]):
   * VARIABLES window shows proper comparison sequence
   * Watch expressions demonstrate correct minimum finding:
     - words[minIndex] updates as new minimums are found
     - Comparison uses current minimum instead of first element
   * Debug stepping shows correct elements being selected

2. After fixing Bug 2 (comparing with i):
   * VARIABLES window shows:
     - Correct swap conditions being evaluated
     - minIndex properly compared with current position i
   * Array contents in watch window show proper ordering
   * Final array shows correct ascending order:
     {"apple", "banana", "hello", "milan", "programming", "zebra"}

Analysis:
Bug 1: Using words[i] in comparison meant algorithm always compared against
      first element instead of current minimum (words[minIndex])
Bug 2: Comparing minIndex with j instead of i meant swap condition was 
      checking against loop variable instead of current position

Fix Implementation:
1. Changed if(my_strcmpOrder(words[i], words[j]) == 1) to
   if(my_strcmpOrder(words[minIndex], words[j]) == 1)
2. Changed if(minIndex != j) to if(minIndex != i)
